 Thank you for following me! Your comments and hearts really make my day :)

A timeline heavy animation using SVG and Greensock. I don't do these very often because I prefer to generate motion with math :) but it was fun to do some so called "hand-coded" motion for the occasion.

HUGE thanks to @AmeliaBR who helped me debug issues in Firefox + Safari. Looking pretty good for me in FF right now, sometimes it works in Safari but sometimes it just totally chokes out and the paths stop drawing. Guess I'm just animating too many things to render :)
